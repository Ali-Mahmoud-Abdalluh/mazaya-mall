## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Rationale

This project was built from the ground up using core web technologies to ensure maximum performance, maintainability, and a lightweight footprint. No heavy frameworks were used.

| Technology | Purpose & Rationale |
| :--- | :--- |
| **HTML5** | Used semantic HTML for better structure, SEO, and accessibility. |
| **CSS3** | Leveraged modern CSS features like **Flexbox**, **Grid**, **Custom Properties** (Variables), and **Keyframe Animations** to create a responsive and dynamic layout without JavaScript dependencies for styling. |
| **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)** | All interactivity is powered by dependency-free JavaScript. Using the native `fetch` API for asynchronous calls, **Intersection Observer** for scroll-based animations, and **DOM manipulation** for the mobile menu and language switcher ensures the site is fast and lean. |

## üìÇ Project Structure

The repository is organized logically, separating the page content from its static assets for clarity and ease of maintenance.

```

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ index.html              # Main landing page (entry point)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ 404.html                 # Custom "Page Not Found" error page
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ static/                 # Directory for all static assets

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

This project requires no build tools or compilation steps.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ali-Mahmoud-Abdalluh/mazaya-mall.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd mazaya-mall
    ```

3.  **Run locally:**
    Open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser. For the best experience (to avoid potential CORS issues with `fetch`), it is recommended to use a lightweight local server like the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension for VS Code.

## üîå Contact Form & API Integration

The landing page features a critical lead-generation form that integrates with an external CRM.

*   **Endpoint URL:** `https://api.engazcrm.net/webhook/integration/mazayacapital/4/8/1`
*   **HTTP Method:** `POST`
*   **Request Payload:** The form's JavaScript handler constructs a JSON object and sends it via the `fetch` API.

    **Example JSON Payload:**
    ```json
    {
        "full_name": "John Doe",
        "mobile": "01012345678",
        "email": "john.doe@example.com",
        "last_comment": "Lead from website form."
    }
    ```

*   **Functionality:** The submission logic provides clear user feedback with different button states:
    *   **Default:** "Send Message"
    *   **On Submit:** "Sending..." (with a loading spinner)
    *   **On Success:** "Sent Successfully!" (form clears, button turns green)
    *   **On Error:** "Submission Failed" (button turns red)
